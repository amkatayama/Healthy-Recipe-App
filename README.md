## Planning

### Situation Analysis

My clients are my mother and my grandmother, and they are currently facing a problem of having to think of what to cook for meals. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone in their family members now stay in their houses for the whole day. Therefore, they need to cook three meals every day, for all of their family members. In June, 2020 I received a text from my mother on behalf of her and my grandmother (appendix A). She told me that they are in need for something that can help them to come up with different menus for every meal. They don't want to cook the same thing every day, and they are having trouble coming up with non-repetitive menus. Furthermore, they want their family to eat healthily, with balanced nutrition.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution to this problem is to create a software that provides an easy way for my clients to search for variety of menus, along with the ingredients, recipe and nutrition data. Both of my clients use an iPhone, however they can only  perform basic operations such as texting and seraching on the internet. Hence, the applicatoin should be designed in way that it can be used in these two simple steps:  

> 1.	Type in a keyword (eg. chicken, tomato)
> 2.	Scroll through and tap on the desired recipe to see details 

These are the only steps that are required by the users. As for the application, it will have a search bar for users to type in a keyword and the results page users can scroll down to see the search result. After the user has tapped on a specific recipe, it will present the ingredients, recipe, and nutrition data in one glance.

Another function this application should have is a system which notifies the users that the menu has been used recently, to prevent them from making a repetitive recipe unconsciously. This means the system should remember the most recent search history. The search histories will vary with different users, and to this issue, I decided to ceate a login system for each user so that the search history stays within their user page.
