## Planning

### Situation Analysis

My clients are my mother and my grandmother, and they are currently facing a problem of having to think of what to cook for meals. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone in their family members now stay in their houses for the whole day. Therefore, they need to cook three meals every day, for all of their family members. In June, 2020 I received a text from my mother on behalf of her and my grandmother (appendix A). She told me that they are in need for something that can help them to come up with different menus for every meal. They don't want to cook the same thing every day, and they are having trouble coming up with non-repetitive menus. Furthermore, they want their family to eat healthily, with balanced nutrition.

### Proposed Solution

The solution for this is to create an iOS app that provides a way for my clients to look for a variety of menus, along with the ingredients, recipe and nutrition data. My clients both use iPhone, and they can use basic functions such as texting or searching on internet, This should be done in two
in two simple steps: 

The proposed solution to this problem is to create a software that provides an easy way for my clients to search for variety of menus, along with the ingredients, recipe and nutrition data. Now, this should be achievable in two simple steps:  

1.	type in a keyword (eg. chicken, tomato)
2.	look for and tap on the desired recipe to see details 

These are the only steps the users need to follow. As for application, what it should do after a keyword has been typed in is shown a search page with the search results of multiple possible recipes, corresponding to the keyword. After the users have tapped on the menu they want, it should present the ingredients, recipe and nutrition data in one glance. 

Another function this application should have is a system which notifies the users that the menu has been used recently, to prevent them from making a repetitive recipe unconsciously. This means the system should remember what the users searched previously. This varies with different users, thus a secure login system would also need to be embedded, so that each user has their own dedicated page.
